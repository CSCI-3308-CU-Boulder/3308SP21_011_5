## Project Description
This Website is a simple message board that students and teachers can communicate freely with each other. The initial goal was to make something that would be equal if not better than piazza. At its start we had developed a rather robust plan with the intentions to develop new features in parallel to the material covered in class. With varying levels of experience we knew we would be able to work on multiple stages of the project in parallel to each other following the principles of angular.
 <br>
While the end product has retained some of the features we wanted to complete appeared in the final iteration of the project. In the future starting testing would have helped us accomplish more as that took up the majority of some of our memberâ€™s time. But collectively we eventually found out what we did well in. John worked well on the backend, Matt worked well on hosting, Omar was great at mobile compatibility and UI work, Carol was good at bug testing, and Conor was good at UI work. While some features did not work out, we are ultimately pretty happy about the end results.
