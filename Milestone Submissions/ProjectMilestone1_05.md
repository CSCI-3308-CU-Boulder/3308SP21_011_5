## Application Name
ClassView

## Application Description
ClassView helps to manage questions and posts between teachers and students with a smooth UI and additional back end features. For the students, they will have access to posting and answering questions as well as post notes to help out other students. And for the teachers, they will have access to view student activity, post their own questions as well as set deadlines for responding to posts. A feature that both students and teachers should have access to is referencing prior posts to help redirect irrelevant questions.

The value of ClassView lies in its ease of use and relevant data. Ideally the system will remove irrelevant details and help bring students quickly to the answers they seek. Reducing the need for irrelevant posts, making it easier to moderate for teachers. Additional features pending.

## Vision Statement
For students and teachers who want to have a more effective online message board, ClassView is an online forum that offers intuitive tools for managing information. Unlike piazza which tends to flood the user with a lot of irrelevant information, the app will limit unimportant posts and offer users a clean experience.

## Version Control

## Development Method
This team will be using a Kanban development system. The team will use an Epic/Story system to manage tasks but will instead circulate tasks based on requests generated with each given task. Those tasks will then go into development and be completed before being supplied the next set of necessary instruction. Minimizing the time required completing secondary tasks and features that are not necessary and allowing each part of the system to be developed exactly when they are necessary. Though this process is dependent on each step being completed the risk can be mitigated by regular communication. This will also give each team member to work at their own pace without worrying too much about sprints and classes at the same time.

## Communication Plan
Our team plans to communicate regularly throughout the week and provide updates on completed tasks on the Jira board, while meeting once a week with both the TA and team mates to discuss progress. These discussions will be done on Discord, and the TA will be provided access to the meeting once they accept their invites. The two hour session amongst teammates will serve as a group work period in hopes of addressing and fixing minor issues that may have come up during the week, as well as a chance to get group input on how the current process is going, should workflow change, be it assign or remove tasks from members. The meetings with the TA will focus on addressing any roadblocks that could not be resolved beforehand and get insight from a third party.

## Meeting Plan
The team has agreed to meet on Saturdays 12PM MST for our general team meetings on discord.
Meetings with TAs will also happen on discord at 11:45AM MST for our meeting with TAs. Teammates have agreed to catch up on the lecture for that day at their leisure.
