Post Questions:
These can be posted either publicly or privately. This is so that students can get their questions answered from classmates, TAs, or Teachers.

Respond to Questions:
This should also be manageable either publicly or privately. So students, TAs, or Teachers can answer questions posted by students. There should also be some way to collect metadata on who has posted this for a relative time frame.
 
Activity Reports:
Teachers and TAs should be able to see who has been active over a relative time frame as well as keep track of what posts are answered properly and who isn’t.

User Management:
Reset password. Change profile picture. Change notification preferences. Change UI theme (dark/light mode) Also change username and password(?)

Class Management:
Teachers and TAs can be assigned different roles. Roles will have different privileges.

Blocking/time out:
Teacher/TAs/.. Can easily block students’ posts who are trying to troll by posting answers. Also students who rant in the forum can be timed out.

Ability to include code snippets and latex code in posts and comments
